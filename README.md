Based on Jay DoubleU's "Development Expanded", this mod seeks to simplify the dynamic development and remove some features to make the game run faster and be more compatible with major overhauls. It also fixes the annoying problem of AI nations becoming desolate wastelands every game.

Features:
- Adds an incentive for a more peaceful playstyle to the game, since your land loses development from devastation
- Automatic development over time for all provinces owned by a non-native/non-tribal nation, with each province receiving 1 random development point every so often (10 years average) depending on its development cost
- Automatic removal of development from devastated provinces
- Passive culture spread within each empire, with options menu to change how/if this works
- Highly optimized code so you won't even notice it happening (despite iterating through every province every year!)
- The ability to disable manual development. (Not really, just increases base cost by 900%, but thats good enough to make the ai not do it)

Notes:
- The built-in development cap scales with dev cost reduction, so getting more dev cost reduction will increase your provinces development cap. For example in vanilla your provinces will grow until the cost to develop them is 50 mana, so when you reduce the cost below 50 with ideas, edicts, etc., it will develop more until it reaches that threshold again. This threshold is the "base cost" of the province, and may change mod-to-mod
- In case you want to develop certain provinces for missions, estate agendas, institutions, or something else, there is a decision to disable the dev cost penalty for a month

Compatbility:
- No DLC required
- Obviously not compatible with Jay's Development Expanded
- 100% savegame compatible, feel free to add or remove whenever!
- Should be compatible with everything (including mods that add new provinces) as its purely event-based, as long as they dont overhaul how development works
- Note: Incompatible with Imperium Universalis as it overhauls how development works, but I helped make their system :)
- Does not work with patches prior to 1.35
- Specifically tested for compatibility with Vanilla, Extended Timeline, Ante Bellum, Voltaire's Nightmare, Anbennar, Europa Expanded, Post Finem, The Odd Empires, and Gods and Kings

Known Issues:
- Europa Expanded has some issues with 0/0/0 provinces. I think I fixed it but if you see a tooltip saying a province is "too remote and inhospitable to colonize" let me know
- "Development Cost Modifier" given by adm tech has to be manually entered for each mod, so if there are any mods that change vanilla tech progression (like ET), I will have to hard-code a workaround. I have alr done this for the mods listed above but if you want more mods added let me know what modifiers are given at what tech levels. That being said it will still work with those mods, just certain numbers may be wrong late-game
- Bug reports are welcome, please feel free to reach out in comments or on discord @DudeChris33
